# Data-Pipeline
Data Pipeline for processing large loads of course data from the Web Scraper

# Current Plans
Make a proof-of-concept pipeline using PySpark to focus on finding viable data transformations to the different Postgres tables

# Future Plans
Potentially migrate to Scala (mostly because Spark code is natively written in Scala)

# Why Spark
There's a lot of course data to process, not sure if Pandas would be enough
